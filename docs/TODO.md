## Current Status

**Phase 1 Progress: 13/13 tasks completed (100%) âœ…**

**Ready for Phase 2: Multiplayer & Controls**

The core foundation is now complete with all essential features:
- âœ… Event-driven client-server architecture  
- âœ… Real-time story generation with AI integration
- âœ… Dual input modes (Direct/Influence) with validation
- âœ… Competition system with secret goal generation and scoring
- âœ… Complete terminal UI with Blessed.js
- âœ… Comprehensive export system with analytics
- âœ… Full CLI interface with all commands

## Key Implementation Details Completed

- **Event-driven architecture** using EventEmitter patterns throughout
- **Session management** with proper player tracking and cleanup
- **LiteLLM integration** with PDL templates and request queuing
- **Logging system** with session-specific logging as specified
- **Configuration validation** with all required parameters
- **Socket.io events** matching the planning document specification

## Testing Criteria for Phase 1

- [ ] Server starts and accepts connections on configured port
- [ ] Client connects and displays story interface correctly  
- [ ] Story seeding works with 30-second timer and skip functionality
- [ ] Both input modes submit to server and integrate into story
- [ ] Competition goals generate and display properly
- [ ] Story exports to markdown with all analytics

## Addendum: Phase 1 UI Reimplementation (Modular) â€“ Completed âœ…

Date: 2025-08-30

Summary: Rebuilt the terminal UI per Phase 1 design into a modular, reliable architecture using Blessed, improving input handling, rendering stability, and state management while preserving keybindings and features.

Completed tasks:
- Refactor UI to modular components (Blessed):
  - Added `src/client/ui/components/StoryView.js` (story + recent inputs)
  - Added `src/client/ui/components/StatusBar.js` (time, players, phase, last message)
  - Added `src/client/ui/components/InputBar.js` (single-line textbox; proper submit)
  - Added `src/client/ui/components/Modal.js` (reusable modal for Help/Goals)
- Centralized UI state and ticker:
  - Added `src/client/ui/uiState.js` (session snapshot, story text, inputs, goals, messages)
  - Implemented 1s local countdown ticker synced from `session_update.timeRemaining`
- Rewrote `src/client/ui/terminalUI.js` to use components and state store
  - Routed all input through `InputProcessor` for validation and mode handling
  - Reliable key handling: Tab (mode toggle), G (goals), Down (skip placeholder), ? (help), ESC/Ctrl+C
  - Modal overlays for goals and help with clean focus and dismiss behavior
- Improved input reliability
  - Replaced textarea enter-handling with `blessed.textbox` submit flow
  - Eliminated double-render/focus churn; render now component-driven
- Updated CLI wiring to pass `InputProcessor` to TerminalUI
  - Modified `src/cli.js` for `start`, `create`, `join` commands

Follow-ups (Pending in later phases):
- Server event `goals_assigned` to populate goals automatically (UI supports `setPlayerGoals`)
- Implement skip coordination on server and broadcast status to clients
- Configuration panel (C) and multi-view cycling (Shift+Tab) per planning.md Phase 2/3
