# Story Chef - CLI Interactive Storytelling App Plan

## Core Concept
A client-server command-line interactive storytelling app that generates stories continuously using AI models, 4-6 sentences at a time every 30 seconds. Users seed the initial story themselves and can inject custom instructions at any moment to influence the narrative in real-time. Stories have a 10-minute time limit with automatic conclusion. Features persistent server sessions, robust multiplayer with seamless join/drop handling, and streamlined post-story rating system.

## Technology Stack
- **Architecture**: Client-server separation with Socket.io communication
- **Server**: Node.js server handling AI integration, session management, and logging
- **Client**: Terminal-based client connecting to local or remote servers
- **Configuration**: JSON config files with in-game editing interface
- **AI Integration**: LiteLLM for unified access to 100+ LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama, etc.)
- **Networking**: Socket.io for real-time multiplayer with reconnection handling
- **File System**: Server-side logging, session persistence, and story exports
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js for argument parsing
- **Terminal UI**: Blessed.js for multiple view management and real-time updates
- **Session Management**: Redis or in-memory store for persistent game sessions with auto-cleanup
- **Performance**: Connection pooling, AI request queuing, memory-efficient session storage

Alex stepped through the massive oak doors, the scent of old books 
and magical herbs filling the air. The Great Hall stretched before 
them, its ceiling enchanted to show a swirling galaxy of stars. Luna's 
whiskers twitched as powerful magic permeated every stone. Professor 
Willowmere raised her staff, and the sorting crystal began to glow 
with otherworldly light. "New students, please step forward for the 
House Sorting Ceremony," her voice echoed through the hall.

Other first-years shuffled nervously around Alex, their eyes wide 
with wonder and fear. The crystal pulsed brighter, casting dancing 
shadows across the stone walls. Luna suddenly hissed softly, her 
tail bristling as she sensed something unusual about the magical 
artifact. The headmistress frowned slightly, as if she too noticed 
the crystal's strange behavior. Alex felt the family heirloom in 
their pocket grow warm against their leg.

[Condensed summary of story so far...]

Alex has arrived at Thornwick Academy and discovered their family 
heirloom reacts strangely to the sorting crystal. They've been 
sorted into Ravenclaw House and are now exploring the castle with 
new friends Sarah and Marcus. Luna has been investigating mysterious 
magical disturbances in the castle's foundation...

Current scene: Alex and friends are about to enter the restricted 
section of the library following Luna's lead...

üìö THE CONCLUSION üìö

With courage born from newfound friendship, Alex channeled the power 
of their family heirloom to stabilize the ancient magic. The crystal 
stopped its dangerous pulsing, the castle's foundation grew steady, 
and Professor Willowmere smiled with relief. Luna settled contentedly 
on Alex's shoulder as the headmistress announced that this year's 
first-years had already proven themselves true Thornwick students. 
As the friends walked to their first class together, Alex knew this 
was just the beginning of many magical adventures to come.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
**Testable Deliverables:**
- Basic client-server architecture with Socket.io communication
- Server can start/stop and accept client connections
- LiteLLM integration supporting OpenAI, Claude, and local models
- PDL prompt configuration system with template loading
- Single-player story seeding (30-second timer with ‚Üì skip)
- AI story segment generation using PDL templates
- Basic dual input modes (Direct Story vs Influence)
- Contribution tracking system (word counts, input types)
- Basic terminal UI with Shift+Tab view cycling
- Simple story export with contribution analytics

**Testing:** Can start server, connect client, seed a story, use both Direct and Influence input modes, generate AI segments that weave both input types, and export story with basic analytics.

### Phase 2: Multiplayer & Controls
**Testable Deliverables:**
- Multiplayer sessions with game codes
- Real-time dual-mode input synchronization (Direct/Influence)
- Skip controls requiring unanimous agreement in multiplayer
- Enhanced multi-view interface (Story/Direct/Influence/Live/Chat) with Shift+Tab cycling
- Player join/leave notifications with contribution tracking
- Live input view showing player input modes [DIRECT] vs [INFLUENCE]
- Basic disconnect/reconnect handling

**Testing:** Multiple clients can join same session, use both input modes collaboratively, see each other's input types in real-time, skip segments together, and switch between all 5 views.

### Phase 3: Performance & Scalability
**Testable Deliverables:**
- AI request queuing and rate limiting for concurrent sessions
- Session auto-cleanup and memory management
- Performance monitoring and connection pooling
- In-game configuration panel (C key) with live LiteLLM model switching
- Advanced PDL prompt customization and template management
- Session persistence across server restarts

**Testing:** Server handles 20+ concurrent sessions smoothly, AI requests are properly queued/rate-limited, memory usage stays stable, and model switching works seamlessly.

### Phase 4: Web Terminal Frontend
**Testable Deliverables:**
- Express.js web server with xterm.js terminal interface
- Web-based Socket.io client matching CLI functionality exactly
- Mobile-responsive design with touch keyboard support
- Direct URL sharing for easy session joins (e.g., /join/MAGIC-FOREST-7429)
- Web and CLI clients can participate in same sessions seamlessly

**Testing:** Users can access full Story Chef experience through browser, collaborate with CLI users in real-time, and share session URLs for instant joining.

### Phase 5: Advanced Analytics & Polish
**Testable Deliverables:**
- Late join capability with story catch-up and contribution history
- AI-generated author involvement summaries using PDL templates
- Advanced contribution analytics (word counts, participation patterns, thematic analysis)
- Enhanced exports with detailed authorship attribution and AI author summaries
- Post-story rating system (1-5 stars + comments)
- Server logging with IP addresses and detailed session tracking
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Documentation and deployment guides

**Testing:** Full end-to-end experience including real-time model switching, advanced analytics generation, AI author summaries, mid-session joins with contribution history, complete rating collection, and comprehensive story exports with detailed authorship analysis.

## Key Features Summary

### Core Mechanics
